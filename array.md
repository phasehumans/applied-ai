### Array

- what is array data structure?
    - python dont have built in array, we use list, array module or numpy
    - stores related values together under one name
    - one single big box, with separate compartments, w/ position
- why to use arrays?
    - if we have realted values, we should group them na, why should we store them seperately has unrelated vars
    - to treat diff values has one unit
    - group related data and perform operation
- how array in python diff from c++ and java?
    - C++ : contigous memory allocation, actual raw value is stored in array
    - python : non contigous, ref(pointer) is stored
        - how it is non contigous?
            - python stores ref of obj(value) -> arr = ref|ref|ref|ref| ; actual obj can be anywhere in memory
            - they are logically cont but physically non-cont
                - why not to do similar like C++, why so much headache?
                    - python wnat everything to be object
                    - mixed datatypes
                    - dynamic resizing
                    - when raw speed matters, we use numpy(cont arrays)
- what is diff betn array and list?
    - array : multi values of same type, in contigous memory, accessed using index, stores raw value
    - list : collection of items, w/ flexible size, stores ref of object(raw value)
    - python dont have built in array
        - what python use for actual cont allocation?
            - array module
            - numpy -> actual contigous memory
- what are techniques use to solve array questions?
    - brute force
    - two pointers
    - sliding window
    - prefix sum
    - hashing (freq/lookup)
    - sorting + logic
    - greedy thinking
    - kadane's algo
    - binary search
    - monotonic stack
    - bit manipulation
